## Installation

### Installation Steps for New Zealand Walks API:

1. **Install Prerequisites:**
   - Install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) for your platform.
   - Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Create a New API Project:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to create a new ASP.NET Core API project:
     ```bash
     dotnet new webapi -n NZWalksApi
     ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Change into the newly created project directory:
     ```bash
     cd NZWalksApi
     ```

4. **Open the Project in Your IDE:**
   - If you're using Visual Studio Code:
     ```bash
     code .
     ```
   - If you're using Visual Studio, open the solution file (`NZWalksApi.sln`).

5. **Configure the Database (if applicable):**
   - If your API interacts with a database, configure the database connection in `appsettings.json`.
   - Run migrations to create the database:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
     dotnet ef database update
     ```

6. **Run the API Locally:**
   - Execute the following command to run the API locally:
     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```
   - The API should be accessible at `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`.

7. **Test the API:**
   - Open a web browser or a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test your API endpoints.
   - By default, the API should have a sample endpoint like `WeatherForecast`.

8. **Explore and Modify:**
   - Dive into the code, explore the controllers, and models.
   - Customize the API to represent New Zealand walks.

9. **Documentation and Swagger (Optional):**
   - If desired, add [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for API documentation.
   - Install the Swagger NuGet package:
     ```bash
     dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
     ```
   - Configure Swagger in `Startup.cs`.

10. **Deploy (Optional):**
    - To deploy your API, publish it to a hosting platform like [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
